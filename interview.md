    new Thread(() -> handleClient(clientSocket)).start();
}
```

### File Transfer Mechanism

- **Progress tracking**: Real-time feedback during transfers
- **Error handling**: Connection recovery and validation

#### Directory Structure
```
project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/          # Files available for sharing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ downloads/       # Files downloaded from peers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PeerClean.java   # Main application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ServerThread.java

## üé§ COMMON INTERVIEW QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

### Q1: "Why did you choose TCP over UDP for file transfer?"
**Answer**: TCP provides reliable, ordered delivery which is crucial for file integrity. File transfers require guarantee that all bytes arrive correctly and in sequence. UDP would require implementing our own reliability layer, adding complexity without significant benefits for this use case.

### Q2: "How does your system handle multiple simultaneous connections?"
**Answer**: The ServerThread creates a new thread for each incoming connection using a thread-per-connection model. This allows multiple peers to connect and transfer files simultaneously without blocking each other. Each connection is handled independently with proper resource cleanup.

### Q3: "What happens if the network connection drops during file transfer?"
**Answer**: The system uses try-catch blocks around socket operations to detect connection failures. When a connection drops, the transfer stops gracefully, error messages are displayed, and resources are cleaned up. The user can retry the operation after reconnecting.

### Q4: "How would you scale this system for production use?"
**Answer**: 
- **Connection pooling**: Reuse connections instead of creating new ones
- **Distributed hash table**: For peer discovery without central server
- **Chunk-based transfer**: Resume interrupted downloads
- **Compression**: Reduce bandwidth usage
- **Authentication**: Add security layers
- **Load balancing**: Distribute connections across multiple threads

### Q5: "Explain the difference between your client and server components."
**Answer**: Each peer runs both:
- **Server component (ServerThread)**: Listens on a port, accepts connections, serves files to requesting peers
- **Client component (ClientHandler)**: Initiates connections to other peers, requests file lists, downloads files
This dual role makes it truly peer-to-peer rather than traditional client-server.

### Q6: "How do you ensure thread safety in your application?"
**Answer**: Each connection gets its own thread with isolated resources. File operations use proper exception handling. The main application thread handles user input while background threads manage network operations. Shared resources are minimized and properly synchronized where needed.

### Q7: "What design patterns did you implement?"
**Answer**: 
- **Command Pattern**: Menu options map to specific operations
- **Observer Pattern**: Progress tracking during file transfers  
- **Factory Pattern**: Thread creation for connections
- **Singleton-like**: FileManager as utility class
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different handlers for different peer operations

### Q8: "How would you add security to this system?"
**Answer**:
