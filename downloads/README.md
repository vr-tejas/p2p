# Downloads Directory

## Purpose
This directory stores files that you download from other peers in the P2P network.

## How It Works
1. **Connect to a peer** using option 1 in the menu
2. **List their files** using option 2 in the menu
3. **Download files** using option 3 in the menu
4. **Downloaded files appear here** automatically

## File Organization
- Files are saved with their original names
- If a file with the same name exists, it may be overwritten
- Check this directory after successful downloads

## Automatic Creation
- This directory is created automatically when the application starts
- Downloaded files appear here immediately after transfer completion
- The application handles all file I/O operations

## Important Notes
- Downloaded files are stored locally on your machine
- Make sure you have sufficient disk space for large files
- Scan downloaded files for viruses if you're downloading from untrusted peers
- Files remain here until you manually delete them
