ðŸš€ JAVA PROGRAMMING TIPS ðŸš€

1. Understanding Sockets:
   - ServerSocket listens for connections
   - Socket represents a connection between two endpoints
   - Use BufferedInputStream/OutputStream for efficient file transfer

2. Threading Best Practices:
   - Always close resources in finally blocks or use try-with-resources
   - Use thread-safe collections when sharing data between threads
   - Consider using ExecutorService for better thread management

3. Exception Handling:
   - Catch specific exceptions rather than generic Exception
   - Log errors with meaningful messages
   - Always clean up resources in case of exceptions

4. Network Programming:
   - Set timeouts for socket connections
   - Handle network interruptions gracefully
   - Use proper buffer sizes for optimal performance

5. File I/O Tips:
   - Use BufferedReader/Writer for text files
   - Use byte streams for binary files
   - Always close streams to prevent resource leaks

Remember: Practice makes perfect! ðŸ’»
